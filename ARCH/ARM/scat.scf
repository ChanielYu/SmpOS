; This scatterloading descriptor file defines:
; one load region (FLASH) and a number of execution regions
; (FLASH & 32bitRAM etc.)
;
; The entire program (code & data) is placed in FLASH which resides 
; at 0x24000000, of length 0x4000000 bytes.  On reset, an aliased copy 
; of FLASH is re-mapped (by hardware) to address 0x0.  Program 
; execution starts at AREA Init in init.s, which is placed 
; '+First' in the image.  Following reset, the first few 
; instructions of init.s remap 32bitRAM to address 0x0.
; (The ARM Integrator Board remaps its Flash in this way)
;
; Most of the RO code will execute from FLASH (its execution 
; address (0x24000000) is the same as its load address (0x24000000), 
; so it does not need to be moved (a 'root region'))
;
; 32bitRAM might be fast on-chip (internal) RAM, and is typically
; used for the stack and code that must be executed quickly.
; Here, the exception vectors (AREA Vect in vectors.s) get relocated 
; (copied)  from FLASH to 32bitRAM at address 0x0 for speed, so this 
; area is placed '+First' in the region.

; The RW data will also get relocated (copied) from FLASH to RAM.
; The ZI data will get created (initialized) in RAM, above the RW data
;
; The execution region UART0 is used to place a structure over the Integrator
; UART0 registers. This region is marked UNINIT to prevent the C Library 
; initializing this area, i.e writing 0's to peripheral register

; The region HEAP is used to locate the bottom of the heap
; The heap will grow up from this address
;
; The region STACKS is used to locate the top of the memory used to store
; the stacks for each mode. The stacks will grow down from this address
